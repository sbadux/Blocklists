# Blocklists
Download iBlocklists' lists in .dat (aMule/eMule) or .p2p (qBittorrent)

WARNING: 

1) Since I'm not a developer and I'm not even good in programming, these scripts are super-easy. 
They only download Blocklist's lists and merge them into a single file.

2) You need Python 3 to run them. I've tested these scripts on Ubuntu and Fedora.

3) They can work fine (as for me) or not. I'm not responsible of any error/bug/data loss/anything else.

The 2 simple scripts allows you to download iBlocklists' list and save them in .dat or .p2p formats.
